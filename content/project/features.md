### Priorities
- Top-down 2D graphics, with line-of-sight mechanics, as well as lights and shadows.
  Flashlights, flares, or NVGs needed in the dark.
- Procedurally generated world. Static diamond-shaped layout of sections of the world, semi-random 
  rules for the types of sections, as well as the rooms they're composed from.
  Loading screens occur between sections. No backtracking, can't go back to a previously 
  visited section. Start at the top of the diamond, goal to reach the bottom section.
- Multiplayer cooperative play. No PVP or the like planned.
- Physics. Knockback during a brawl, tripping on furniture.
  Throwing objects, small like grenades or rocks, bigger like chairs or cardboard boxes.
  Also 0G movement in times where there's no gravity.
- Varied types of enemies, depending on the section, with different attitudes towards the player.
  Swarms, runners, turrets, gunners, booby traps.
- Sound system aware of walls and distance. 
  For simplicity, probably no echoes or sounds bouncing off of surfaces.



### Would be nice
- Alternative sensory systems. Radar, sonar, infrared, spectrometer gun (!),
  biomass detector, wifi scanner.
- Alternative output systems. Can't connect your eyes to the radar dish. Phosphor screens with long 
  afterimage, slowly-updating electron gun screens, cheap greyscale ink, single-color
  pixel LCD, analog radar/sonar display.
- Parts-based health and armor system. Unprotected limbs are harder.
  Ammunitions with different characteristics, like big knockback, or guaranteed
  bleeding. Because 2D, no headshots?
- Rich equipment and crafting system. Can't carry heavy things, or too many things.
  Can combine things to make better things.
