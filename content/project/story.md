You wake up in your sleeping quarters, awoken by some deafeningly loud alert.
Is it time for the flip-and-burn and change in trajectory? 
No, you're just coasting a non-impulsive at 1G somewhere near Hydrophobia, 
the gas giant, and the screen shows nothing.
Other than a flashing "Code Zeta"... evacuation in progress. That's a new one.

\
You put on gray assistant's jumpsuit, get your anti-burn stimulant 
cocktail packet, and of course your headset and minimum clearance ID.
This was supposed to be a calm and easy seven-cycle, as the crew rotation is soon,
and there's really nothing to do anyway, except chilling and partying.
In fact, you're still hungover, and the alert is not helping.
Hope it's just a test or an error.

There's nobody in the hallways, though...
