**Spectrometry** is a game idea I have wanted to (try to) execute for a long while now, 
and one I have decided to do for my diploma project. Unfortunately, because of that,
it has to be closed-source until then (beginning of 2020). After that, time will tell, 
but open-source is planned.

\
It is going to be a top-down 2D action game, targeting the desktop platforms,
and written in Rust.

\
This site is of course work-in-progress, and will be updated as I work on the game.
